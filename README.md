# ACO VRP FRAMEWORK

This repository contains implementations of the following meta-heuristics for VRP problems:

* VRPTW_ACS for Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problems (DVRPTW) [1]
* ALNS for Multi-pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (MPDPTW) [2]
* TABU_SA for Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (PDPTW) [3]
* LNS for Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (PDPTW) [4]
* ALNS for Dynamic Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (PDPTW) [5]
* TABU_SA for Dynamic Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (PDPTW) [5]
* MMAS for the Travelling Salesman Problem [6, 7]
* MMAS_MEM for the Dynamic Travelling Salesman Problem with Moving Vehicle [8]
* MMAS with LS for the Dynamic Travelling Salesman Problem with Moving Vehicle [9]
* MMAS with US for the Dynamic Travelling Salesman Problem [10]

As extra, it also has some integrations with:

* RINSIM: Framework to simulate VRP problems
