## ACO algorithm for the VRPTW with dynamic requests

File: VRPTW_ACS.java

This Eclipse project represents the ACS algorithm adapted from the mTSP_ACO MinMax global_new heuristic Eclipse project,
for solving the vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW), but in which the number
of used vehicles (or salesmen) is fixed and is known a priori; this value is taken from the best
known solution reported in the literature for that particular VRPTW test instance
(see http://people.idsia.ch/~luca/macs-vrptw/solutions/welcome.htm and http://web.cba.neu.edu/~msolomon/heuristi.htm)

The quantity of the deposited pheromone and the best ant is taken according to the MinSum criterion
(the total sum of the length/cost of each travelled route/tour)
according to the mTSP_ACO MinMax global_new heuristic algorithm, the salesman and the city to
be visited and added in its tour are selected simultaneously during the same step from the
construction phase of solution, reflecting a jointly decision making.
